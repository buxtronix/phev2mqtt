# PHEV Remote protocol (MY18)

A brief description of the protocol used. Determined by analysis and reverse
engineering, together the looking at the [phev-remote](https://github.com/phev-remote)
code.

## Network transport

The client device connects to the car using an SSID with a default format
of *REMOTExxxxxx* where *xxxxxx* is an arbitrary string.

The car assigns the client an IP address over DHCP, usually 192.168.8.47. The
car itself is 192.168.8.46.

The client communicates to the car's address over TCP port 8080. Within the
TCP connection, binary packets are used to exchange data.

## Packet format

Each packet has the following format:

```text
|  1 byte   | 1 byte   | 1 byte | n bytes ... |   1 byte     |
|   [Type]    [Length]    [Ack]       [Data]     [Checksum]  |
```

The fields are:

### Type

One byte.

The type of the packet. Most packet types have a corresponding response type.
See below for known types.

### Length

One byte

The length of the packet, less two. For example a packet that contains two
data bytes has a length field of 4.

### Ack

One byte

The acknowledgement field. Will be 0 for request packets, and 1 for packets
acknowledging a request type.

### Data

Variable length

The data payload for the packet. Depends on the command. The length of this
field is 4 less than the value in the *Length* field.

### Checksum

One byte

The checksum is a basic packet integrity check. To calculate its value, add
up of all the previous bytes in the packet. The least significant octet is
the checksum.

For example, given a packet of `f3040020`, the sum is 0x117, so the checksum
is `0x17`. Thus the entire packet is `f304002017`.

## Security and XOR encoding

Most packets on the wire are encoded with a simple XOR obfuscation algorithm.
Packets from the car will be encoded using a rolling code scheme, and packets
from the client to the car are expected to be encoded similarly.

The algorithm was reverse engineered by @zivillian in
[this issue](https://github.com/buxtronix/phev2mqtt/issues/16) which
contains more detailed notes.

1. Initial security key

Shortly after client connection (and at occasional times during the connection), the
car sends an initialisation packet of type `0x5e` or `0x4e`, depending on the year.
The payload of this packet is used to firstly derive a `security_key` which is a
single byte.

Using this security key, a `key_map` is generated containing 256 distinct byte
values. These byte values are used for the lifetime of the connection or until
another initialisation packet is received.

Two index values are initialised, starting at zero. We'll call these `s_num` and
`r_num` for the send (to car) and receive (from car) directions. The `key_map`
values at the indices represented by `s_num` and `r_num` are the actual encoding
keys, we will call `s_key` and `r_key`.

2. Packet encoding

After the security key map has been established, all further packets to the car
must be "encrypted" with the current `s_key`. Packets received from the car will
be "encrypted" with the current `r_key`, so must be "decrypted" before further decoding.

The "encryption" is done by simply XORing each byte in the packet with the current
corresponding key value, either `key_map[s_num]` or `key_map[r_num]`. Being XOR,
the "decryption" is done the same symmetrical way.

3. s_num and r_num value incrementing

The send and receive keys (i.e `s_key` and `r_key`) only change when certain
packets are sent/received. Otherwise they may be used for multiple packets.

When the car sends a packet of type `0x6f`, the `r_num` is incremented, hence
the new `r_key` will be `key_map[r_num]`. Note that this change is used for
packets *after* the `0x6f` packet.

When the client sends a packet of type `0xf6`, the `s_num` is incremented, hence
the new `s_key` will be `key_map[s_num]`. Note that this change is used for
packets *after* the `0xf6` packet.

`r_num` or `s_num` rollover back to zero if they increment from `0xff`.

## Packet types

Summary:

| Value | Name              | Direction     | Description                          |
|-------|-------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------|
|  0xf3 | Ping Request      | client -> car | Ping/Keepalive request               |
|  0x3f | Ping response     | car -> client | Ping / Keepalive response            |
|  0x6f | Register changed  | car -> client | Notify a register has been updated   |
|  0xf6 | Register update   | client -> car | Client register change ack/set       |
|  0x5e | Security init     | car -> client | Initialise security keys (MY18)      |
|  0xe5 | Security ack      | client -> car | Ack security keys (MY18)             |
|  0x4e | Security init     | car -> client | Initialise security keys (MY14)      |
|  0xe4 | Security ack      | client -> car | Ack security keys (MY14)             |
|  0x2f | Keepalive request | car -> client | Sent by car to check client presence |
|  0xbb | Bad Xor?          | car -> client | Sent when XOR value is incorrect.    |
|  0xcc | Bad Xor?          | car -> client | Sent when XOR value is incorrect.    |

### Ping request (0xf3)

Format:

```text
[f3][04][00][<seq>][00][<cksum>]
```

Seems to be a keepalive sent to the car from the client. The initial XOR seems to be 00
until a 0x5e packet is received from the car. The `<seq>` increments up to 0x63 then
overflows back to 0x0.

### Ping response (0x3f)

Format:

```text
[3f][04][01][<seq>][00][<cksum>]
```

Response to a 0xf3 packet, sent from the car to the client. The `<seq>` matches the
request, though the XOR seems to be chosen by the car and future register update packets
match this XOR until another ping exchange.

### Register changed (0x6f)

Format:

```text
[6f][<len>][<ack>][<register>][<data>][<cksum>]
```

Used to notify the client that a setting register has changed on the car.

If `<ack>` is zero, then indicates a notification of a register value. If `<ack>`
is one, this is a response to a register setting change requested by the client.

The `<register>` is a one-byte value signifying the corresponding register number.

The `<data>` is variable length and dependent on the specific register.

Registers are described below.

### Register update/ack (0xf6)

```text
[f6][<len>][<ack>][<register>][<data>][<cksum>]
```

Used by the client to notify the car of either an ack of a received register update, or setting a new register value.

If `<ack>` is zero, indicates that a register value is to be changed. The `<register>` and `<value>` fields indicate the register and new value.

If `<ack>` is one, is a response to an update (above) received from the car. The `<register>` field is the register value being acked. The `<data>` field contains a single `0x0`  byte.

### Init security (0x5e)

```text
[5e][0c][00][<data>][<cksum>]
```

Sent by the car after around initial ping/keepalive exchanges.

The `<data>` contents are 12 bytes, used to initialise the XOR encryption key map (see above).

This packet is not XOR encrypted.

### Init ack (0xe5)

```text
[e5][04][01][0100][<cksum>]
```

Sent in response to a 0x5e packet. Always seems to be the same.

This packet is not XOR encrypted.

### Bad XOR (0xbb)

```text
[bb][06][01][<unknown>][<exp>]
```

Sent by the car if a received packet is encoded with the incorrect XOR value.

The meaning of the value in the `<unknown>` field is, well, unknown.

The `<exp>` field contains the XOR value which is expected. If the offending
packet is reset using this value for the Xor, then it will likely be accepted.

This can be a workaround given the current unknown algorithm for generating
XOR values.

## Registers

Registers contain the bulk of information on the state of the vehicle.

### Read registers (car to client)

There seem to be two types of register layout (A/B).

| Register | Name                         | Length | Location  | Fields                        | Description                         |
